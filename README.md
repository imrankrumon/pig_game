# Pig Game
Two-player dice roll game developed using JavaScript.
The first player who goes to 100 points wins the game.
If the dice roll is 1, you will lose the current score.
You can hold your score anytime to add it to the total score.
It is a course project by Jonas Schmedtmann.
Using it to showcase my skills.
